# Hypixel Skyblock Net Worth Calculator
Thank you for using and/or checking out the GitHub page for this program I have been developing.
This program is designed for everyone to use but to make sure your value is calculated correctly, please 
follow the guidelines listed below.

- Make sure all items of value are in your inventory or ender chest. It doesn't matter if they are in a backpack or not.
- The program does not look at money in your bank, but instead, your purse, be sure to put all your coins in your purse or keep that in mind for later.
- You will need to use your own API key to run the program.
- This program is still in an early stage and not all items will be counted. If the item is not counted the program will inform you.
- If you have any concerns or other information that I need to know you can contact me through this repository or on my discord server at [discord.gg/sXMwhJH](discord.gg/sXMwhJH)
